```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

## Attempt at data visualization 

No indepth analysis is carried out, just plain basic data visualization is documented here. This script would like to attempt the following question:

- which species have the highest reported kills?
- How does bird kills evolved over time?
- At what time of the day is the kills mostly occuring?


```{r echo= FALSE, include=FALSE}
reports<-wildlife %>%
  count(species)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
reports
unknown_birds<-wildlife %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(species, "Unknown")) %>% 
  summarise(total = mean(n))
unknown_birds

```
